        <p>Howdy! I’m Colin Wright.</p>
        <p>I’m an author, podcast host, and generalist <a href="https://exilelifestyle.com/work"
                title="Colin Wright's work page">maker-of-things</a>.</p>

        <p>I also <a href="https://colin.io/speaking" title="Colin Wright's speaking page">speak</a>
            to audiences worldwide at conferences, universities, and on the periodic national or
            international tour.</p>

        <p>I spend most of my time learning, making things that I hope will be of value, and
            striving to grow as a person—in terms of physical and mental health, knowledge,
            resiliency, and overall capability.</p>

        <p>I’ve been traveling the world full-time since 2009, and for most of that time I had my
            readers vote on what country I would move to next every four months or so.</p>

        <p>For the past few years I’ve experimented with different models, including spending time
            in unfamiliar parts of the US, fixing up and full-timing in a vintage RV (while on
            tour), and at the moment, researching and visiting potential home bases to use as
            jumping-off points for future travels.</p>

        <p><strong>Somewhat More Information</strong></p>

        <p>I’m originally from Northern California, but I grew up in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to be a chaos theorist (I was better at math
            back then) or comic book illustrator; I ultimately pursued a combined journalism and
            fine arts trajectory in high school.</p>

        <p>I worked a handful of design- and technology-related jobs alongside my classes at
            university, and wrote news analysis columns for local newspapers.</p>

        <p>I started my first business, a magazine, when I was 19 and still in school. The project
            went well, then flopped, which was very painful and educational. I graduated with a
            dual-emphasis degree in graphic design and illustration, then moved out to LA to work as
            a generalist “creative” at a small production and design agency.</p>

        <p>After a year, I left the studio job to start up my own one-person operation, at first
            doing an array of design, web, animation, and interactive work, before finding a niche
            in broader-based branding projects.</p>

        <p>Things were going very well, business-wise, when I realized that I was sacrificing
            essentially every other aspect of my life to achieve that success. </p>

        <p>In 2009, I handed off most of my clients, sold or gave away everything I owned that
            wouldn’t fit into carry-on luggage, and started up a blog, <em>Exile Lifestyle</em>.</p>

        <p>In the years since, I’ve lived in Argentina, New Zealand, Thailand, Iceland, India,
            Romania, Czech Republic, and the Philippines, visited about 60 other countries and all
            48 contiguous US states (twice), roadtripped South America, wandered Southeast Asia,
            explored Europe by train, and enjoyed many other travel-related adventures.</p>

        <p><strong>Yet More Information</strong></p>

        <p>I make friends and build relationships of different kinds as I travel: I have some
            truly amazing and inspiring people in my life.</p>

        <p>I’m fortunate to have a wonderful family. My parents live in central Missouri and my
            three siblings are scattered around the US. I have quite a few fur-nieces and
            fur-nephews.</p>

        <p>I’m a minimalist in that I own few things and am intentional in how I consume. This
            doesn’t mean I’m anti-consumption, but rather that I’m careful about how I spend my
            time, energy, and resources (including money). I tend to buy less but invest in
            quality, and I aim for the same in relationships, the work I do, and everything
            else.</p>


        <p>I’m 35-years-old, left-handed, and cannot believe I get to do what I do for a living.

        <p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>


        <p>If you don’t see an answer to your question below, feel free to&nbsp;<a
                href="https://exilelifestyle.com/contact">contact me</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>How can I do what you do? Traveling is my dream!</strong></p>

        <p>Great! There are many ways to travel long-term or full-time. As many ways as there
            are people, in fact.</p>

        <p>A few things to be thinking about:</p>

        <p>Great! There are many ways to travel long-term or full-time. As many ways as there
            are people, in fact.</p>

        <p>A few things to be thinking about:</p>

        <p>1. What do you want to get out of travel? What do you hope to achieve by living in
            this way?</p>

        <p>2. How might you earn an income while on the road? What skills do you possess that
            might allow you to work independently or remotely, and what skills might you acquire
            that would help you do so?</p>
        <p>4. It’s also important to consider the ethical implications of your travels,
            including the emissions created by various travel methods, and the damage that can
            be caused by visitors to landmarks, cities, and natural settings. This damage can
            include things like the transmission of diseases, but also general wear-and-tear on
            plants, paths, andnatural settings. This damage can include things like the
            transmission of diseases, but also general wear-and-tear on plants, paths, and
            architecture, alongside potential economic recalibrations that can ruin an area for
            locals as it becomes more accessible by visitors.</p>

        <p>From there, it’s a good idea to set a deadline and to use the time leading up to that
            deadline as a runway before take-off. Don’t rush, but don’t put it off forever,
            either.</p>

        <p>Focus on what’s vital, make sure you know why you’re doing it, and make sure it’s
            sustainable: economically, but also psychologically and physically.</p>

        <p>Then go out into the world, try to leave places and people you encounter better than
            you found them, and do your best to be present for the experiences you have along
            the way.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p><strong>Do you accept guest posts/submissions for your blog?</strong></p>

        <p>Nope, sorry.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p><strong>Can I buy an advertisement on your blog?</strong></p>

        <p>Nope, sorry.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p><strong>Wait, if you don’t display ads like a smart business person, how do you make
                money from your blog?</strong></p>

        <p>The short answer is: I don’t.</p>

        <p>The longer and more complete answer is: I don’t make money directly from my blog, but
            it serves as a means of communicating with my audience, who are able to get a taste
            for my work, and who may, as a result, decide to pick up one of my&nbsp;books,
            attend a conference at which I’m&nbsp;speaking, or&nbsp;support my podcast.</p>

        <p>It’s a slow-burn means of making a living, but it’s one I feel good about. I wouldn’t
            be able to say the same if I bombarded folks with marketing messages or overwhelmed
            them with blinking ads, promoting widgets they don’t need.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p><strong>Will you come speak at my conference/event/school/business?</strong></p>

        <p>Perhaps!&nbsp;<a href="http://colin.io/speaking">Here’s some info about hiring me as
                a speaker and how that all works</a>.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p><strong>Aren’t you a minimalist? Isn’t it counter to your philosophy to sell
                books?</strong></p>

        <p>Nope. Being a minimalist doesn’t mean owning nothing, it means owning exactly the
            right things for one’s needs and priorities. It’s not about being anti-consumption,
            it’s about being anti-compulsory consumption.</p>

        <p>I try to only own things that add value and happiness to my life. There are many
            other things I could own that would only weigh me down or consume resources (time,
            energy, money) that I could instead spend on truly valuable things (‘valuable’ being
            defined by my needs and priorities).</p>

        <p>If a book brings you joy, helps you learn, or exposes you to new ideas, there’s a
            good chance it passes muster, minimalism-wise. Though that won’t be the case for
            everyone—if your money is better spent on something else according to your
            standards, please do that, instead.</p>

        <p>If a book brings you joy, helps you learn, or exposes you to new ideas, there’s a

            everyone—if your money is better spent on something else according to your
            standards, please do that, instead.</p>

        <p>I also encourage folks who buy my books to hand them off to a friend or donate them
            to a library afterward, which is a good way to enjoy the benefits of a tangible book
            without adding any clutter to your life.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
        <p><strong>How do I write a book?</strong></p>

        <p>The first step is to start writing. A&nbsp;<em>lot</em>.</p>

        <p>Many people want to write a book but don’t write, or are afraid to start writing
            before they feel they have the entire publishing scaffolding in place.</p>

        <p>Don’t do that. Don’t wait for permission.</p>

        <p>Get started, write all the time. It’s the only way to get better, and it’s the best
            possible way to sound more like yourself and develop your personal style.</p>
